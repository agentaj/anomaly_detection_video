# anomaly_detection_video
An anomaly detection network for video analysis based on variational autoencoder is created here. It is based on compressing a number of frames into a single image for conserving the spatio-temporal relationship of the objects, a/nd the feeding this combined image to an autoencoder network for training. The jupyter notebook file Dynamic_image.ipynb is used for combining the images. data.ipynb is used for training on the model created using tensorflow on the background. test.ipynb is used for testing the model.
